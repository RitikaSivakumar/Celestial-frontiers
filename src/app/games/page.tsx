Thereâ€™s no right or wrong way to play â€” just move slowly and feel the serenity in each motion.\n\nYou can pick up the polished stones and place them anywhere you wish. Notice how each movement changes the balance and stillness of your garden.\n\nIf you like, save your creation to return later, or let the ripples fade away naturally as you breathe and relax.\n\nTake a deep breath.\nThis moment is yours.\n\nðŸª· Focus: Calm Â· Mindful Â· Creative\n\nâœ¨ Play for as long as you likeâ€¦ the sand always welcomes you back."

It pops quietlyâ€”listen to the subtle â€˜popâ€™, watch the bubble disappear, notice the little movement of nearby bubbles. Take a slow breath inâ€¦ and as you exhale, pop another bubble. No rush. Just calm tapping, gentle rhythm. When youâ€™ve popped enough, drift softly back into stillness.",

See how the waves move, overlap, slow down. Pause. Breathe in as the first ripple starts, breathe out as it disappears. Continue for a few taps, exploring the calming effect. When youâ€™re ready, let the pond still."

With every match you make: take a slow inhaleâ€¦ and as the tiles disappear, take a slow exhale. Let your mind soften. Continue matching until you feel ready to stop and just observe the empty board for a moment."

As you move your finger, imagine the colour flowing from your fingertips into the screen, and any tension flowing out. If you like, tap â€˜eraseâ€™ gently and let the stroke fade. Thereâ€™s no goal, just your expression. When you feel done, step back, take a breath, and observe your creation or let it fade into blankness."
